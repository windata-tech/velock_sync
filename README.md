# velock_sync

[English] A dedicated synchronization program for Velock. We plan to support all platforms, but due to current manpower limitations, the initial plan is to launch on mobile first, followed by the desktop. We also welcome everyone to submit PRs and work together to make it better and better.

[中文] 给格间的专属同步程序，计划支持全平台，但目前限于人力实在是有限，计划先上移动端再上桌面端。同时也欢迎大家提交PR，大家一起把它越做越好。

## Getting Started

Keep going!
